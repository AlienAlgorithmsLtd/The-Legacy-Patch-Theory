## 1. Respect All Submissions

- All contributions must be approached in good faith.
- Avoid dismissing ideas without reasoned, constructive input.

## 2. Keep Discussion Focused

- Stay on topic. This is not a space for off-topic debate or unrelated content.
- Submissions must directly relate to simulation theory or the defined scope of Legacy Patch Theory.

## 3. No Abuse or Harassment

- No personal attacks, trolling, or hostile behavior.
- Disagreement is allowed — disrespect is not.

## 4. Maintain Integrity

- Do not falsify information or present fictional content as fact.
- Cite sources when applicable. Theories must be clearly marked as such.
