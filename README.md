The Legacy Patch Theory (LPT) presents a radical synthesis of memory integrity, signal leakage, and simulation instability. It proposes that reality, as collectively experienced, is governed by a hidden update system — timed with astronomical phenomena, enforced at key historical intervals, and silently resisted by those immune to systemic overwrite: the Legacy Memory Holders.

These individuals recall versions of events, cultures, or timelines that are no longer verifiable. Their memories, once dismissed as false, are now reclassified as residue from deprecated simulation builds — evidence of skipped or failed patching cycles. What was once seen as misremembering is now reframed as diagnostic recall from alternate system instances.

Core Case Files
These documents represent major breach points, signal anomalies, and timeline ruptures investigated within the LPT framework:

🦍 The Koko Event (2015)
A potential system-level signal leak from a biological observer node. Koko the gorilla’s unscripted statement during COP21 — “Nature see you” — is analyzed as an unpatched broadcast from a non-verbal diagnostic channel.

📡 The WOW! Signal: Pre-Patch Anomaly (1977)
A single 72-second hydrogen-line signal interpreted not as a message, but a rupture — a pre-patch diagnostic leak from a collapsing subsystem. Its absence afterward suggests successful patch suppression or thread deletion.

📡 The WOW! Signal Bounce Theory: A Reverse-Origin Hypothesis
A reclassification of the WOW! Signal as a return transmission — not sent to us, but by us. This theory posits the signal as a 100-million-year-old outbound packet that rebounded from a simulation boundary and returned post-patch, revealing a potential containment wall at the edge of the observable universe.

⏳ Time-Based Anomalies Outside LPT (The Quarantine Layer)
A classified set of thread anomalies — events like the Philadelphia Experiment, the Taured Incident, and the Green Children of Woolpit — that fall outside simulation update logic. These are threads that resisted deletion, survived overwrite, or returned with valid credentials from deprecated Earth builds.
